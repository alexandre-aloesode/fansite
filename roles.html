                Tanks heroes are the most durable among all in mobile legends. These front-line giants help in attacking enemies. They're 
                usually found leading the charge, choosing the right times and situations to initiate aggression. Many tanks can also protect 
                their more fragile teammates by stunning or pushing around dangerous foes and limiting their damage potential. In mobile 
                legends, most classes of heroes are really versatile in terms of abilities and with the item crafting variations a "tank" 
                can be played as a DPS if you choose the right equipment. Usually, tanks are laning on the bottom tower. Tank has high 
                defense and hit point, but low damage. When used properly, a tank could be the strongest hero in the game.

                The Support role is to aid and help protect your allies in any situation. Your role is is to shield or heal them, 
                to tanking some damage, or sacrificing yourself to keep others alive. You are often giving up the glorious kills in 
                the game to support others but in the end, it's usually the support to secure the true MVP award. Support heroes 
                usually lane with the marksman in the top lane or at the mid lane to be able to travel quickly where they are needed.

            <span>
                A magician (abbreviated as mage) is a hero with a longer range, ability-based area of effect damage, and crowd 
                control that they may utilize to strike from a distance. Mages primarily focus on magic skills that deals magic 
                damage, usually burst damage, and as a consequence, they spend a lot of gold on equipment that allows them to do 
                more damage and have shorter skill cooldowns.Though mages typically focus on killing prime targets in combat, they 
                can also use their innate crowd control and utility to manipulate opponents, protecting their team from them or 
                setting them up for a takedown, and in the right circumstances, can damage and control multiple enemies at the same 
                time. Regardless of their might, mages are fundamentally frail and succumb fast to direct attacks.

            <span>
                Marksmen are ranged heroes whose power is almost entirely based on their basic attacks: by using their reach to land 
                massive continuous damage from a distance, marksmens are capable of taking down even the most difficult opponents 
                when positioned behind the safety of their team, and perform better at securing objectives such as the Lord and 
                turrets.

            <span>
                An assassin is an agile hero that specializes in killing or disabling roaming targets picking them of as they try to 
                replenish HP. Focused on infiltration, deception, and mobility, assassins are opportunistic hunters who find 
                favorable moments within a fight before jumping into the fray. Regardless of the size of the enemy team, assassins 
                specializes in positioning and artful killing. They strike when the time is right â€“ no sooner, no later. 
                Assassins are more suitable to be played by experienced players as they have low HP and high burst damage. 
                They are ideal for taking out opponents easily, but are easier to be killed due to bad positioning and wrong timing.

                Fighters are close range combatants that possess a mix of offensive and defensive capabilities. A fighter's damage 
                will add up over time to make it a major threat. Each fighter has a unique blend of mobility, damage, disruption and 
                durability. Fighter is an intermediate melee heroes, between durability or damage, hence make fighter serve as multi 
                purpose combatant, such as Semi Tank, Crowd Controller, or Burst Damage Dealer.
